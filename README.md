# emag-scraping


* Ever got tired of e-shops increasing the items' prices just before a "major sale" so then they can lower them and justify the "*25% SALE*" tag?

* Always trying to find out if you're actually getting the item at its best price? 

This project tries to solve all these problems for Romania's biggest online shop, [eMAG](https://emag.ro), who's has shown in the past that pumping up prices 
just before Black Friday or any other major sale is not something to be ashamed of.

The end product will be a free, no-ad website with the prices (and maybe more!) of thousands of products, spanning over several months so anyone can see if the 
price of the item they are looking for is really at its lowest or they're being tricked into buying it.
